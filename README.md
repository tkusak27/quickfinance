# QuickFinance (Hackers in the Bazaar Project 03)

### Purpose
The inspiration for this site is educational websites like IXL, leetcode, and Khan Academy, with the hope of taking the best features of that website.

Currently, LeetCode exists for Computer Science majors to practice their coding assesment skills, but *as far as I know*, no equivalent site exists for business majors. 

The primary purpose of this website is to provide an **interactive, almost "addicting" website where users can learn and refine their core finance skills**.

### Open Source
Because I am *not* a business major, its safe to say I don't have the most robust knowledge of finance. This project utilizes a **Question Submission Portal**, where members of the QuickFinance community can submit questions to be peer reviewed and potentially added to the site:

### Architecture
My plan is to create this web application using Django as a backend, primarily because I have experience with it. Because I am trying to "gamify" learning, the frontend will be built using React, which I have less experience with it (hopefully learning a bit of js in paradigms will be of use). For the actual problem sets themselves, I have not decided how I plan to roll them out, although I figure I will need a database of sorts that allows concurrent reads (sqlite ruled out).

### Presentation
I will be presenting this partly complete (1 skill, basic home page set up) project to my class in December. For the final presentation, I plan on including the following pieces to satisfy the requirements:
* Demonstration of the site
* A slideshow which includes steps on how to download the source code, make changes, and ideally a way to add new problems to the website
